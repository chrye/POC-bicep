Build dynamic pipelines with a complex JSON object.

I rearranged the GEO-ENV-ServiceConnection info differently and please see the attached JSON file. 

Basically you’d specify each combination individually instead of lumping them together under GEO.

And in your pipeline, you can read out from the JSON file, looping through and parse out each field. 
I did several variations and passing the JSON around as variable won’t work as that strips out the double quotes. 

So you’d need to read/parse/use the content altogether, look in the 'Read and Print' section. 
If ServiceConnectionName cannot take a variable value while calling a template, then you can define a parameter and switch the variable value out with the corresponding parameter.
